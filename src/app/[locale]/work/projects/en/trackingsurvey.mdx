## Overview

Development of Custom web application for survey tracking, response processing, data analysis, indicator calculation, and reporting.

## Key Features

- **Graphics Reporting**: Developed a comprehensive graphics reporting system that generates dynamic charts and visual reports based on real-time data, allowing users to easily analyze and interpret results.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens. This system enables users to tailor the UI to their preferences or branding requirements.
- **Excel Import and Data Reporting**: Implemented an Excel import feature for seamless data entry, which integrates with the reporting system to display multiple charts and summaries based on the imported data.
- **User Authentication and Real-Time Survey Tracking**: Developed a user login system for secure access and tracking of surveys in real time, allowing users to monitor progress and results dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: Used to build robust and scalable backend services for fast, server-rendered React applications, enabling seamless integration between the frontend and server.
- **HightCharts**:  Implemented for creating interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs to effectively display data insights.
- **Bootstrap / JQuery**: Utilized for rapid UI development, styling, and DOM manipulation to ensure responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **MySQL**: Leveraged as the relational database management system to store and retrieve data, supporting the creation of an interactive and fully documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

The delivery timeline was tight. We were able to make significant progress by generating mockup data until the client finalized the calculation of the indicators.

## Outcome

We met the delivery deadline. The ability to display case progress in real-time was well received.
