## Overview

Development of a Web Application and Android Application for National Crop Survey and Agricultural Yield Estimation.

## Key Features

- **Custom Geometries manipulation**: Enabled advanced geospatial data processing and editing, allowing users to modify and manage custom shapes and geometries effectively.
- **Geomtries synchronization Android APP**: Implemented backend processes to ensure seamless real-time synchronization of geometries between the web application and the Android app.
- **Shapes / Geometries import**: Developed Python scipts to import and process complex shapes and geometries, ensuring compatibility and integration with the existing system.

## Technologies Used

- **Postgres - Postgis**: Utilized for advanced geospatial data storage and processing.
- **PHP - Codeigniter**: Developed backend processes to automate and streamline UI integration.
- **Bootstrap - JQuery**: Implemented for responsive design and dynamic UI interactions.
- **Python**: Used to maintain a unified design system for consistent collaboration.
- **API Restful**: Designed and integrated APIs to synchronize data across platforms.
